The purpose of your journal, and this assignment, is two-fold:
1. To develop the **habit** of keeping notes as you work.
1. To develop **accountabilty** for your work by establishing a record of how you've been using your time.

## Getting Started

These are strange times and, for most of you, this is a completely new school experience. Therefore:
* Keep it simple.
* Start by tracking when you're working on this class. Enter
   - The date
   - When you start
   - When you finish
   - What you did, for example "Zoom meeting" or "Worked on project" or "Made a list of missing assignments."
* Expect it to take a while for tracking your work to become second nature. Forgive yourself when you slip up and start again. Keep trying.

## Submitting Your Journal

At the end of each week, submit the shared link to your journal. Please **do not** share it with me via e-mail, if you do that I'll be flooded with e-mail and there won't be a record of your submission in Canvas (and so it will be scored as missing).
